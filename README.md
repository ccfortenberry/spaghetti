# Spaghetti Sort
A lot of people say that this is just a joke sort that isn't reasonably implementable in the way it was originally described by Alexander Dewdney in his Scientific American column, and to them I say HOW DARE YOU! Joke sorts are perfectly reasonable to implement even if they are only supposed to be a physical model of a linear-time sorting algorithm! The joke is only funny if we understand the context behind it.

## Goal
+ Time complexity: O(n)
+ Space complexity: O(n) - doesn't need to be in-place
+ Stable: yes

## Todo
- Get max tracking down to linear time
